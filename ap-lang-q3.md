# AP Lang Q3 Essay
My friend suggested I try to get it to write an essay. I went with an AP Lang Q3, as it doesn't require that we ask GPT3 to read sources to responding.

### Params
I choose the following params fairly randomly:
```
temperature:  0.9
top-p:        0.2
freq-penalty: 0.2
pres-penalty: 0.2
```

The **bold** text is the prompt, which also includes the introductory paragraph of a [top-scoring response from a previous year](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap19-apc-english-language-q3.pdf). Note that the prompt is fairly long, as I had a hard time getting the program to create valid completions.

**After much deliberation, we have determined the following essay to be the best we as the AP have ever seen. The essay prompt begins on the next line:**

**The term ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù is often used to diminish concepts, places, roles, etc. that the speaker believes do not deserve the prestige they commonly enjoy; for example, many writers have argued that success is overrated, a character in a novel by Anthony Burgess famously describes Rome as a ‚Äúvastly overrated city,‚Äù and Queen Rania of Jordan herself has asserted that ‚Äú[b]eing queen is overrated.‚Äù**

**Select a concept, place, role, etc. to which you believe that the term ‚Äúoverrated‚Äù should be applied. Then, write a well-developed essay in which you explain your judgment. Use appropriate evidence from your reading, experience, or observations to support your argument.**

**The essay begins on the next line:**

**My English teachers may be shocked upon my writing this. The language department may gasp and murmur ‚Äî some poor Board of education member may even faint upon knowing what I've done. But after years and years of this forced, drab, weary curriculum, I cannot hold my silence any longer. I think that "classical literature" is overrated. ... You've heard this before, most probably ‚Äî it is the typical cry from those from "my generation", which you adults have for so long scoffed and rolled your eyes at. However, I reiterate again ‚Äî I think classical literature is overrated, due to my inability to relate to it, as a modern person living in a wide, diverse era.**

**Take Shakespeare, for example ‚Äî an absolute favorite that** is read and reread in most schools. His works are not my cup of tea, and I do not enjoy reading them. They are tedious, and the plot is often so hard to follow that I become lost in the story. However, this is not the only reason why I think that Shakespeare is overrated. It is also overrated because it is taught so much in schools. I am a person who likes to learn, and I enjoy the challenge of reading something that is difficult to understand. However, I am not so enthusiastic about reading a play that is so old that it's language is completely different from what I am used to.  I think that the English curriculum should be updated, and the classics that are taught should be more modern. The curriculum should be more inclusive of modern works, and the classics should be taught in a way that is more appealing to students. 

I believe that the reason why many people are not as enthusiastic about reading the classics is because they are so old. They are often difficult to understand, and they are taught in a way that is boring and tedious. I think that if the classics were taught in a more modern way, then more students would be interested in reading them. For example, just this year, we read "The Scarlet Letter" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. In this book, the characters often used archaic words that I had never heard of before. The book was very difficult to understand, and I was often confused by the plot. However, when we read the book in class, we were given a list of words that we did not know, and we were told to look them up in the dictionary. This made the book much easier to understand, and I was able to enjoy it more. 

I think that the classics are overrated because they are taught in a way that is not appealing to students. I think that if the classics were taught in a more modern way, then more students would be interested in reading them. When faced  with a difficult book, I think that it is important to have a teacher who can help you understand it. I think that if the classics were taught in a more modern way, then more students would be interested in reading them.

The generated text is fairly repetive, and breaks down towards the end. I would not hire GPT3 to write an essay for me, haha üòã
