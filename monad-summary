# Monad Summary
This is a short one. I'm excluding the prompt, because it's not really relevant. Basically, I asked GPT to ELI5 the following:

> A monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors.

And I got the following response:

> A monad is a special kind of object. It is a sort of like a shape. You can put things inside it, but you can't take things out.

I mean it's not *wrong*, but it's not right either. Needless to say, neither GPT3 or I are expert Category Theorists.
